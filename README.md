# deep_nn_model_with_only_python_100%_test_accuracy
deep learning model with only python and numpy with test accuracy 99 % on mnist dataset and different optimization choices 


## model description
the model implemented in just one function because i thought it will be helpful to see the whole training process in one place 

## model features 
1 - binary model 
2- contain three different optimization methods (gd , rms_prob , adam)
3- contain l2 regularization 
4- different choices for activations function (sigmoid , relu , tanh)
5- predict function

## what you can improve 
1- you can rebuild the model with classes to be more structured 
2- you can add softmax activation in case you want use it for multiclasses i didn,t implement it because i thought there is more important think to focus on
